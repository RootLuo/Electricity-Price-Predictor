					<h2>The Project</h2>
                    <p class="lead section-lead">
						This project aims to forecast changes in the wholesale price of electricity based on the factors we have identified as influencing the price, giving 
						policy makers a tool to guide their decisions.
					</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
						Recently, owners of nuclear power plants in the midwest have seen their 
						<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-09/business/ct-exelon-closing-nuclear-plants-0308-biz-20140309_1_quad-cities-plant-byron-plant-exelon" target="_blank">profitability decline</a>. 
						In particular, Exelon corporation, the owner of several 
						nuclear plants in northern Illinois, has lobbied for policy changes to secure their revenues and ensure their ongoing financial viability. These arguments are 
						cast against the backdrop of an electricity sector being pushed to integrate more low-carbon sources of electricity. As nuclear currently constitutes the 
						<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&t=3" target="_blank">largest source</a> of low-carbon power in the US, shuttering of these plants 
						would make it more difficult to comply with the EPA's <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants" target="_blank">
						Clean Power Plan</a> regulations, 
						and, more generally, would make it more difficult to achieve the long-term emissions reductions neccessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
					</p>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						Policymakers are now faced with the dilemma of whether or not and by how much to support these plants. As nuclear plant revenues are a direct function of 
						wholesale power prices, the risks and tradeoffs of the debate could be clarified with an accurate forecast of future electricity prices&mdash;this is the 
						challenge our project attempts to address.  
					</p>
					
					<h2>The Price of Electricity</h2>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						What determines the cost of your electric bill? At first glance, it may seem obvious: how much electricity you use over the course of a billing cycle. But 
						the cost of turning on that light, or running that air conditioner, may be different from day to day, even if you power them on for the same amount of time. 
						The reason for this is that the wholesale price your utility pays for electricity varies from day to day&mdash;in fact, it varies from hour to hour (your 
						utility averages these hourly variations and charges you a daily price). The wholesale price your utility pays for electricity depends, in turn, on how 
						much power your neighbors use, and your neighbors' neighbors, and so on. Thus, your electric bill is determined not only by how much electricity you use 
						over the course of a billing cycle, but also by how much electricity was used by the people in your area. (If everyone turned on their air 
						conditioners, the demand for electricity would increase, and its price would rise accordingly.)

					<h2>Gathering Data</h2>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						<a href="https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/section_prices.cfm" target="_blank">According to the US Energy Information Administration</a>, the key factors 
						that influence wholesale power prices are demand for electricity and the cost of fuel 
						for generators. We gathered historical electricity demand data from wholesale market operator websites, and since natural gas and coal are the largest sources 
						of electricity production in the region. Though wind generation still only makes up a small portion of total electricity generation, it has been fingered as 
						a culprit for depressed wholesale prices, and therefore we also include it as a feature in our model. 
					</p>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						Unlike the rate for electricity you pay at home, wholesale power prices vary by time and location. For this reason it was important for us to train our 
						model on the price at the specific locations of Exelon's nuclear plants in question. The map detail on the left shows the approximate location of these 
						plants.
					</p>
					<h2>Initial Observations</h2>
					<p class="lead section-lead">
						Observations and predictions were made based on a dataset of <b>32,017</b> records.
					</p>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						The figure below displays the results of our data collection efforts: the historical values of wholesale, electricity, gas and coal prices, 
						electricity demand, and wind generation in the Midwest region. It is notable that wholesale electricity and gas prices both fell significantly in 
						2008&ndash;2009. Coal prices fluctuate but show no clear trend, while wind generation capacity has steadily increased since 2008 and shows increasingly sharp seasonal 
						variation (while wind and demand are both displayed in units of MWh and scaled in a way to reveal trends, as wind is actually a tiny fraction of total 
						electricity demand). Megawatt-hours (MWh) are a common unit of measure for both electricity generation capacity and demand, and the price data gathered by the 
						project team for wind generation and demand is in dollars per Megawatt-hour ($/MWh).
					</p>

                    <h2>Predicting Electricity Prices</h2>
                    <p class="lead section-lead">
						The final prediction model captured <b class="enlarged">93%</b> of the variance in wholesale electricity prices.
					</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
						The project team evaluated a number of analytical techniques to predict wholesale electricity prices using the available data for the years 2008&ndash;2015 
						for overall demand, natural gas prices, coal prices, and wind generation capacity. Linear regression techniques generally produced poor results, achieving a 
						maximum accuracy of only 44% (as measured by r-squared). This may partly be explained by the numerous non-linearities we observed in the relationships between 
						features in our model. With this in mind, we decided to try a Random Forest Regressor, which is an ensemble of different regression trees and is considered 
						appropriate for non-linear multiple regression. This approach resulted in enormous gains in accuracy: the final predictive model was able to capture 93% 
						of the variance in wholesale electricity prices using the selected predictors. The project team suspects that the Random Forest approach was better able to 
						capture the cyclical (i.e., non-linear) nature of our time series data, which fluctuates depending on the hour of the day, day of the week, and month of the year.
