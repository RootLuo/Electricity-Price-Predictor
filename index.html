                    <h2>The Price of Electricity</h2>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						What determines the cost of your electric bill? At first glance, it may seem obvious: how much electricity you use over the course of a billing cycle. But 
						the cost of turning on that light, or running that air conditioner, may be different from day to day, even if you power them on for the same amount of time. 
						The reason for this is that the wholesale price your utility pays for electricity varies from day to day&mdash;in fact, it varies from hour to hour (your 
						utility averages these hourly variations and charges you a daily price). The wholesale price your utility pays for electricity depends, in turn, on how 
						much power your neighbors use, and your neighbors' neighbors, and so on. Thus, your electric bill is determined not only by how much electricity you use 
						over the course of a billing cycle, but also by how much electricity was used by the people in your area. (If everyone turned on their air 
						conditioners, the demand for electricity would increase, and its price would rise accordingly.)
					</p>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						The price your utility pays for its electricity is itself set by regional markets across North America. These markets invite owners of power plants to 
						submit bids for how much it will cost the power plants to produce enough electricity to meet demand.
					</p>
					<h2>In Search of a Carbon-Free Future</h2>
					<p class="lead section-lead">
						
					</p>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						For many years, and especially since the severe damage done to the Fukushima Daiichi plant by the tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011, nuclear 
						power has found itself surrounded by controversy. They operate using a particularly dangerous type of fuel, and failures can result in widespread
						effects that linger on, sometimes for decades. Nevertheless, nuclear power currently represents the <a href="">largest source</a> of low-carbon power 
						in the United States. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power do not yet provide a decisive fraction of the electricity 
						needed to meet demand, and it may be some time before that happens. In the meantime, nuclear power is filling that gap.
					</p>
					<p class="section-paragraph">
						
					</p>
					<h2>What Drives Electricity Prices?</h2>
                    <p class="lead section-lead">Demand, the price of natural gas, the price of coal, and the amount of power generated by wind turbines have the greatest impact on the price of electricity.</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
						Recently, owners of nuclear power plants in the midwest have seen their profitability decline. In particular, Exelon corporation, the owner of several 
						nuclear plants in northern Illinois, has lobbied for policy changes to secure their revenues and ensure their ongoing financial viability. These arguments are 
						cast against the backdrop of an electricity sector being pushed to integrate more low-carbon sources of electricity. As nuclear currently constitutes the 
						largest source of low-carbon power in the US, shuttering of these plants would make it more difficult to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan regulations, 
						and, more generally, would make it more difficult to achieve the long-term emissions reductions neccessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
						Policymakers are now faced with the dilemna of whether or not and by how much to support these plants.
